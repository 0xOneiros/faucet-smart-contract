## EVM Faucet Smart Contract - Solidity file

## ðŸ›  If you are a beginner, it is better to use this contract only in TESTNET

### Step 1: Deploy contract on Remix

Upload file on Remix & Edit

```bash
https://remix.ethereum.org/
```

select SOLIDITY COMPILER

```bash
solidity ^0.8.0
```

ENVIRONMENT
```bash
Injected Provider - METAMASK
```

### Step 2: Go to network explorer & Verifying Smart Contracts
For example, if you run the contract on the base network, you must verify it using this guide:
```bash
https://docs.base.org/base-camp/docs/hardhat-verify/hardhat-verify-sbs/
```
